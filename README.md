React Application Structure based on Atomic Design Principles:

###Why Atomic Design?
When I first started using this methodology, it was with a large React Single Page Application (SPA). 
We had a lot of custom components to create and this wasnâ€™t a solution we could find when looking at present CSS
frameworks and libraries. So the result was having to create these components by building them with HTML elements
and using custom CSS. The concept of having one location with all the components was actually quite
interesting and it actually led to faster development times.

Atomic design is atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages concurrently working together to create 
effective interface design systems.
